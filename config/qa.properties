#Great question! In real-world projects, you do not need to move your Java Selenium project 
#into 3 different Git repositories for QA, UAT, and PROD environments.
# Best Practice (Real Project Style):
#Keep a Single Git Repository, and manage environments using:
#Separate test data/config files for each environment
#Dynamic environment selection (via CLI args, Jenkins params, or properties)
#Jenkins jobs or pipelines that pass the target environment at runtime
